Ahmed Abdelmaaboud is A seasoned **cyber security expert** based in Amsterdam ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± with nearly 14 years of experience. I began my career in 2009 as a hacker and have since specialized in offensive security, focusing on Penetration Testing and Red Teaming. My career has spanned government roles, Big Four consulting, and the financial sector, providing me with a well-rounded skill set.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to build and lead offensive security operations for various organizations, discovering zero-day vulnerabilities and publishing technical findings. My work also involves regulatory assessments like **TIBER**, and **iCast**.
